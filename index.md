## Overview

I build **production-grade Machine Learning and Generative AI systems**
with a focus on:

- End-to-end ML systems (data → model → API → production)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with grounding and governance
- LLM deployment using AWS Bedrock, FastAPI, and Kubernetes
- Evaluation, feedback loops, and alignment (RLHF-style)

This site provides **system-level deep dives** into selected projects,
aligned with real-world production constraints.
