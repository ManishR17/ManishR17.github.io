# Manish Reddy
### Senior Machine Learning & Generative AI Engineer

I build **production-grade Machine Learning and Generative AI systems**
with a focus on **LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), evaluation,
and scalable cloud-native deployment**.

My work spans:
- End-to-end ML systems (data → model → API → production)
- Enterprise GenAI platforms with grounding, governance, and evaluation
- LLM deployment using AWS Bedrock, FastAPI, and Kubernetes
- Feedback-driven optimization and AI safety (RLHF-style)
